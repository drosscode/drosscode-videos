OS X 10.5.6.

My Eclipse 3.4 is going crazy lately. 

After innocent operations like typing text or moving some files in Navigator view or saving, it sometimes starts "waiting on background operation", and eats one CPU core, shuffling back and forth tens of megabytes of memory.

I suspect some of plug-ins went rogue.

How can I find which one it is (except for binary search)?
