Which one of the following do you do:

    var = true;
    if (...) var = false;

Or

    if (...) var = false;
    else var = true;

Is there a reason you pick on or the other?

I'm working on the premise that nothing else is happening to var. The next line of code might be something like:

    if (var) { ... }
