I've got a bunch of [unicode characters][1] from U1F000 and upwards, and I'm wondering how to represent them in Java. A Java unicode escape is on the form "\uXXXX" and the Java language specification says that "Representing supplementary characters requires two consecutive Unicode escapes". How does that apply to U1F000?

    String mahjongTile = "\u0001\uf000";

Does not **seem** to work (I only get two blank squares), but that may be a font-glitch, I presume.
