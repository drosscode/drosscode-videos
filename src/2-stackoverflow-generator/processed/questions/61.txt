How can I set current `document.domain` in WebBrowser Control to avoid "Access is denied" in Cross-domain calls (XMLHTTP Requests or Iframe/frame access)?

I've tried 

    CurrentDocument = WebBrowserControl.Document
    CurrentDocument.domain = "example.com"
    Console.writeline("xx" & CurrentDocument.domain)

This doesn't work, somehow it never reaches console.writeline

Am I doing something wrong? Or should I use `WebBrowserControl.ActiveXInstance` ?
