I found several other questions on SO regarding the JavaMail API and sending mail through an SMTP server, but none of them discussed using TLS security. I'm trying to use JavaMail to send status updates to myself through my work SMTP mail server, but it requires TLS, and I can't find any examples online of how to use JavaMail to access an SMTP server that requires TLS encryption. Can anyone help with this?
