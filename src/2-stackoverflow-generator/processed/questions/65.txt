I am new to this, so please dumb it down for me.  I have been tinkering with Objective-C for an iPhone app and have hit a road block.

I am trying to pass the value contained in a variable (string) to a method but it doesn't work. I am guessing it is because the variable is probably a pointer to the value, not the value itself. I wonder if you can suggest how I fix.

Here is the method

    - (UIImage *)newUIImageWithURLString:(NSString *)urlString
    {
       return [[UIImage alloc] initWithData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlString]]];
    }

Sending this message works ... Here I have hard coded the URL, being sent.

    UIImage* newimage = [self newUIImageWithURLString:@"http://images.mydomain.com/PhotoServer/Thumb/97/83358897.jpg"];

This one doesn't ... Here the variable is being passed.I get an error that the
passed value has no value.

    UIImage* newimage = [self newUIImageWithURLString:newListing.ListingPhotoUrl];

I know it does have a value as the following does works.

    self.ListingtitleLabel.text = newListing.ListingPhotoUrl;

Any thoughts?
