Well, my question is simple. 

Does the ID affect the position of a webpage on Google ? 
I have links like this 
`http://example.com/news/title-slug/15/` 
and people say to me that I should remove the ID from the URL. 

And I belive that is not true. By my logic, you can't depend on the title's slug. I know it should work perfectly fine if there aren't two pages that have the same title, but why should I remove the ID if there is no harm when it's there.
