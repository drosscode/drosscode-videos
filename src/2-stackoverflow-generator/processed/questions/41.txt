In bash one can escape arguments that contain whitespace.

    foo "a string"

This also works for arguments to a command or function:

    bar() {
        foo "$@"
    }
    
    bar "a string"

So far so good, but what if I want to manipulate the arguments before calling `foo`?

This does not work:

    bar() {
        for arg in "$@"
        do
            args="$args \"prefix $arg\""
        done

        # Everything looks good ...
        echo $args

        # ... but it isn't.
        foo $args

        # foo "$args" would just be silly
    }

    bar a b c

So how do you build argument lists when the arguments contain whitespace?
