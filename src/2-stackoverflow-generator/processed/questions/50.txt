I am attempting to port one of my hobby project to linux. Preferrably to Mono since it is written in C#. But I am looking into Python as well.

One of the feature of the application is that it needs to associate with a custom protocol so the application is invoked when the user clicks links like this on the app's website:

    myapp://module/action

A custom protocol like [this][1], [this][2] and [this][3].

How can that be done in linux/unix systems? Can I associate a system-wide handler like in Windows? or does it need to be browser-dependent?

Can't find anything on Google. And I am utterly clueless at linux programming.

I need some pointers. Thanks!
