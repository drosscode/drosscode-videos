I am trying to render a simple chart using `SSRS`. The data is in an Excel sheet. I have set up an user DSN and created a data source in `SSRS` using `ODBC`.

I am able to query the excel in `Data` tab. However while trying to preview, I get the following error:

> error [hy000] [microsoft] [odbc excel driver] the connection for
> viewing your linked Microsoft Excel worksheet was lost.

Anyone knows why this is happening and how this can be solved?
