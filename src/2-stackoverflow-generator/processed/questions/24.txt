I am trying to limit the text input into a UITextView in cocoa-touch. I really want to limit the amount of rows rather than the number of characters. So far I have this to count the amount of rows:

    - (BOOL)textView:(UITextView *)textView shouldChangeTextInRange:(NSRange)range replacementText:(NSString *)text {
    	if([text isEqualToString:@"\n"]) {
    		rows++;
    	}
    	NSLog(@"Rows: %i", rows);
    	return YES;
    }

However this doesn't work if the line is automatically wrapped rather than the user pressing the return key. Is there a way to check if the text was wrapped similar to checking for "\n"?

Thanks.
