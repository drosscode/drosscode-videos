I am trying to learn ASP.NET MVC and I hit this problem: I have a "view product details" form that I want to reuse as an add/edit form. (When you look at the product details, if you have the rights to do it an Edit link should appear; it should redisplay the same form, but with the textbox fields enabled this time.)

Right now the Details view looks something like this:

    <% var product = ViewData.Model; %>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><%= Html.TextBox("Name", product.Name, new { size = "50", disabled = "disabled"})%></td>
      </tr>

Is there a way I could reuse it without putting too much logic in the view? For example, I will need to remove the `disabled = "disabled"` part (but the `size` part needs to stay there), to put everything inside a form and so on.

If it can't be done, that's fine, I'm just trying not to repeat the same thing several times in case I need to change it (and I will).
