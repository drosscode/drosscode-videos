On a program of me, the [splint][1] checker warns:

    expat-test.c:23:1: Function exported but not used outside expat-test: start
      A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
      use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
       expat-test.c:38:1: Definition of start

The start() function **is** used. The program uses the [expat][2] XML parser which works with callbacks. You give the parser a function:

	XML_SetElementHandler(parser, start, end);

and the parser calls it back at some points. This is a very common idiom in C and I wonder why splint complains. I find nothing in the [FAQ][3] or in the [manual][4].
