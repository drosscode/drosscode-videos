Without having the full module path of a Django model, is it possible to do something like:

    model = 'User' [in Django namespace]
    model.objects.all()

...as opposed to:

    User.objects.all().

EDIT: I am trying to make this call based on command-line input. Is it possible to avoid the import statement, e.g., 

    model = django.authx.models.User

Without Django returning the error:

    "global name django is not defined."
