I have a `StreamReader` object that I initialized with a stream, now I want to save this stream to disk (the stream may be a `.gif` or `.jpg` or `.pdf`).


Existing Code:

    StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(myOtherObject.InputStream);


1. I need to save this to disk (I have the filename).
2. In the future I may want to store this to SQL Server.


I have the encoding type also, which I will need if I store it to SQL Server, correct?
