i'm trying to debug a program, that i don't have the source code for: explorer.exe

It's a native Win32 application from Microsoft, and symbols are avilable.

All i need now is a (graphical) debugger that supports symbols.


 - OllyDbg is a graphical debugger, but doesn't support symbols.
 - Delphi is a graphical debugger, but doesn't support symbols.
 - WinDbg is not a graphical debugger, which supports symbols.
 - Visual C# Express Edition is not Win32 a debugger.
 - Process Explorer supports symbols, but isn't a debugger
 - Process Monitor supports symbols, but isn't a debugger


Have any new graphical debuggers that support Microsoft's symbols server, been written in the last 6 months that i don't know about?


----------

A graphical debugger is one where you can see the disassembly, and can Step Into and Stop Over instructions, e.g.:

Delphi

WinDbg does not show you a series of instructions:
