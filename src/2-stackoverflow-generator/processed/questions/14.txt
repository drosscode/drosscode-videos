I have some XML code that looks like this

    <SEARCHRESULTS>
      <FUNCTION name="BarGraph">
        <PARAMETER name="numList"></PARAMETER>
        <PARAMETER name="maxValue"></PARAMETER>
        <CODE>Some code</CODE>
      </FUNCTION>
    </SEARCHRESULTS>

And I want to extract a list of parameter names for each function, so far I've got the following xsl code

    <xsl:for-each select="SEARCHRESULTS/FUNCTION">
      <ROW>
        <COL><DATA><xsl:value-of select="@name" /></DATA></COL>
        <COL><DATA><xsl:value-of select="PARAMETER/@name" /></DATA></COL>
        <COL><DATA><xsl:value-of select="CODE" /></DATA></COL>
      </ROW>
    </xsl:for-each>

which of course returns the name of the first parameter along with the function name and code.

I want a list of all the parameters for the function in a text string.  Return separated is best, but as long as all the names are in the string I can parse it later on.

I could normalise the parameter records out in the target database - but I'm not going to, I just need them for display purposes really so I don't want to put too much effort in.  This is why I'm looking for a simple text string.

I thought there might be some way of just putting an asterisk in or something.  If not I'll create a variable and add another for-each to build a string - but it just seems like there should be a simpler way

The resulting XML should look like

    <ROW>
      <COL><DATA>BarGraph</DATA></COL>
      <COL><DATA>numList;maxValue</DATA></COL>
      <COL><DATA>Some code</DATA></COL>
    </ROW>

Where the ';' in the second column could be a carriage return or another character that I can specify
