I'm trying to use custom container widgets in gtk.Builder definition files. As far as instantiating those widgets, it works great:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    import sys 
    import gtk 
    
    class MyDialog(gtk.Dialog):
        __gtype_name__ = "MyDialog"
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        builder = gtk.Builder()
        builder.add_from_file("mydialog.glade")
    
        dialog = builder.get_object("mydialog-instance")
        dialog.run()


Now the question is that say I have a gtk.TreeView widget inside that dialog. I'm trying to figure out how to bind that widget to an MyDialog instance variable. 

One cheap alternative I can think of is to call additional method after getting the dialog widget like so:

    dialog = builder.get_object("mydialog-instance")
    dialog.bind_widgets(builder)

But that seems fairly awkward. Has anyone solved this already or has a better idea on how to go about doing it?

Thanks,
