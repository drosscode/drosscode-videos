I am trying to figure out the best way in an asmx web service to indicate null for a date so that I can insert dbnull.value when the user doesn't enter text into a date field.  Currently I have a string field in the class that I am serializing that will serve as the date field.  When that string is blank I insert dbnull.value, otherwise I insert the string converted to a datetime.  IS this the only way or is there a better way?  What about for integers and doubles?  Thanks.
