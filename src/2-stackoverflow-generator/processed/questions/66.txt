I've been reading a lot lately about how joins in DB queries slow things down. Evidently Google App Engine doesn't even allow them.

I'm wondering how people design an app with no joins though. For example I'm working on an app that has `contacts` and `organizations`. A contact can be in many organizations and an organization can have many contacts. How would it be possible to have that relationship without a third table that connects the two entities...

    contacts --< contacts_organizations >-- organizations

Does it mean that in GAE you can't have a many-to-many relationship? You just leave out functionality that would require a join?

I guess you could have a TEXT `organizations` column in the `contacts` table containing a space-separated list of the organization IDs for each contact. That seems a little weird though.
