In a 1-man shop or even (especially) larger shops, how in the world can you maintain a daily build?

If you change the API, or database table etc. you will have to potentially change so many layers in the application, or say the sql initialization script etc etc.

How can you expect the project to build for changes that take more than a day to complete?

Is it a development goal to ensure the build works accross every single change?

(btw, what I understand from a 'daily build' is pressing a button and having production ready code to ship...I am having a feeling I have the wrong option hehe)
