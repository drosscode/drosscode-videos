How do you replicate this in F#?

    interface IMarker
    {
        // No members here
    }

    class MyClass : IMarker
    {
    // can contain code
    }

Update:
The following code does define marker interface, but none of the answers so far manages to producde class that implements this marker interface (see MyClass above)

    type IMarker = interface     end
