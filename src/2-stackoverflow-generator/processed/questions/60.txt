Using MySQL syntax, how would I write a query to return the following (I am including the two table descriptions and the relationship between them):

    TABLE_A (ID, DATE, TABLE_C_ID)
    TABLE_B (ID, AMOUNT, TABLE_A_ID)
    TABLE_C (ID)

I want to return the following, with the specified limitations:

    SELECT 
        TABLE_A.ID, 
        TABLE_A.DATE 
        (SUM TABLE_B.AMOUNT 
             FROM TABLE_B 
             WHERE TABLE_B.ID = TABLE_A.ID) 
        FROM TABLE_A, TABLE_B 
        WHERE TABLE_A.TABLE_C_ID = 123

Thanks in advance.
