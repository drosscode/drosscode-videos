Adding source files more than one directory away (e.g. ../../source.cpp or ../../../somewhere_else/source.cpp, vs. just source.cpp or ../source.cpp) to the SOURCES= declaration in a WDK/DDK build yields the following error:

    Ignoring invalid directory prefix in SOURCES= entry

Is it possible to include remote source files in a build?
