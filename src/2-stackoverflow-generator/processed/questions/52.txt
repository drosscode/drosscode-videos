What are the various parts to an email message?

I'm working with these 3rd party components, and so far from what I understand are:

1. emails have unique messageID's (per server I would presume)

2. emails have headers

3. emails have body text that can be either html or plain text.

4. attachments have to be parsed using mime, and each mime part can have different types like: multipart/ applicatoin/octet-stream and filenames.


side question, where exactly is the documentation that these 3rd party components have to adhere to?
