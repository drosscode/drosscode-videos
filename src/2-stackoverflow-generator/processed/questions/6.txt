What is the best way to test GWT code?

GWTTestCase in hosted mode is too slow and none of the mocking frameworks work.

Currently we are following MVC as suggested in http://robvanmaris.jteam.nl/2008/03/09/test-driven-development-for-gwt-ui-code/ and using GWTMockUtilities disarm() and restore() to mock widgets. And we havent figured out a way to test View in GWT MVC. Is there a better way to test GWT code?
