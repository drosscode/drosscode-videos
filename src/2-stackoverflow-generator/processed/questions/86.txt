Is it possible to have a variable number of fields using django forms?

The specific application is this:

A user can upload as many pictures as they want on the image upload form. Once the pictures are uploaded they are taken to a page where they can give the pictures a name and description. The number of pictures will depend on how many the user has chosen to upload.

So **how do I get django to generate a form using a variable number of input fields** (which could be passed as an argument if necessary)?

**edit:** a few things have changed since the [article mentioned in jeff bauer's answer][1] was written. 

Namely this line of code which doesn't seem to work:

<pre><code># BAD CODE DO NOT USE!!!
return type('ContactForm', [forms.BaseForm], { 'base_fields': fields })
</code></pre>

So here is what I came up with...

The Answer I used:
==================

<pre><code>
from tagging.forms import TagField
from django import forms

def make_tagPhotos_form(photoIdList):
	"Expects a LIST of photo objects (ie. photo_sharing.models.photo)"
	
	fields = {}
	
	for id in photoIdList:
		id = str(id)

		fields[id+'_name'] = forms.CharField()
		fields[id+'_tags'] = TagField()
		fields[id+'_description'] = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
		
	return type('tagPhotos', (forms.BaseForm,), { 'base_fields': fields })

</code></pre>

note tagging is not part of django, but it is free and very useful. check it out: [django-tagging][2]
