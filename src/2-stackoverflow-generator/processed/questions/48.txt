I am current writing an application and need to show the current days of the week.

So, for the coming week I need to generate the follow dates.

Monday, 5 January 2009
Tuesday, 6 January 2009
Wednesday, 7 January 2009
Thursday, 8 January 2009
Friday, 9 January 2009

I have already coded the application to generate five dates from the current date. The problem I have is finding a method to create Monday through to Friday on the current week.

I am running OS X 10.5 and am using the Cocoa environment.
