I&#39;ve always had good luck with [Netcat][1]. A very simply command line utility that allows you to send anything you want over TCP/IP. [HTTP][2] itself is quite simple, so you can just hand craft it. Example usage:

    nc www.mywebsite.com 80
    GET / HTTP/1.0
    (hit return twice)

Charlse HTTP proxy tool is my favorite. You can manually create HTTP request or edit existing HTTP request. [http://www.charlesproxy.com/][1]

The completely free tool is Fiddler which has similar functionalities [http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/][2]

Charlse runs on different operating systems, it is on top of java VM.
Fiddler runs on windows dot net.
I&#39;ve found [Tamper Data][1] quite useful Firefox plugin to fiddle with HTTP headers and parameters. This is very useful if/when you want to hack your (or someone elses :) ) site.

For the Mac I like HTTP Client.

Woot!
If you need a more powefull application then look at WebScarab. Runs on java and packed full of features mainly to monitor but is more of an advanced security tool.
 
&gt; WebScarab is designed to be a tool for
&gt; anyone who needs to expose the
&gt; workings of an HTTP(S) based
&gt; application, whether to allow the
&gt; developer to debug otherwise difficult
&gt; problems, or to allow a security
&gt; specialist to identify vulnerabilities
&gt; in the way that the application has
&gt; been designed or implemented.
