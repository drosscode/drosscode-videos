Edit based on clarified question:

Numerous frameworks can be configured to intercept an html request - for instance asp.net can be set to handle any given extension and an HTTPModule could do anything with that. It&#39;s really up to web server configuration what it decides to do with any request.

*also: you don&#39;t really want to be saying &quot;hijack&quot;*
A likely option is that they are using a content management system where &quot;html&quot; on the URL doesn&#39;t actually mean it&#39;s a static html file.
This may be out of left field, but I&#39;ve certainly used the occasional JS function to grab everything in the header and either parse it or pass it to another script using AJAX.

I&#39;ll sometimes use this method in a 404.html page to grab the headers of the previous page, parse them out to see where someone was *trying* to go and redirect them.

That is, as annakata said, one of the numerous options available.
