Alright, I guess I answered my own question.

One way to do the above is to override gtk.Buildable&#39;s parser_finished(), which gives access to the builder object that created the class instance itself. The method is called after entire .xml file has been loaded, so all of the additional widgets we may want to get hold of are already present and intialized:

    class MyDialog(gtk.Dialog, gtk.Buildable):
        __gtype_name__ = &quot;MyDialog&quot;
    
        def do_parser_finished(self, builder):
            self.treeview = builder.get_object(&quot;treeview1&quot;)
            # Do any other associated post-initialization

One thing to note is that for some reason (at least for me, in pygtk 2.12), if I don&#39;t explicitly inherit from gtk.Buildable, the override method doesn&#39;t get called, even thought gtk.Dialog already implements the buildable interface.
