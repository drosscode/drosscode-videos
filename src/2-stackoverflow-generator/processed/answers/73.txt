I don&#39;t think AutoComplete quite captures it. See this discussion on Joel on Software:

I think &quot;content assistance&quot; or something like that would be acceptable in an academic paper. As another poster in that forum pointed out, I think Intellisense is becoming much like Kleenex or perhaps &quot;google&quot; (verb form).
If you are referring to the small list that pops up, I usually refer to it as the autosuggest popup menu.
I think the term &quot;Intellisense&quot; is probably the most wide spread and only takes a couple of ticks to understand. I&#39;d go with that.

Until I worked with Visual Studio, the term I was most familiar with was &quot;Code Insight&quot;, which again is easy to understand.
[Intellisense][1] is what Microsoft calls it, and that seems to be in general use. &quot;Autocomplete&quot; works fine too.

[intellisense][1] is the microsoft adopted name for what you are looking for :)

[AutoComplete][2] is the term that is used in other programs non-Microsoft property

&quot;Autocompletion&quot; is the more generic term. I&#39;d avoid vendor-specific jargon.

(In addition, in the unlikely event, a reader who doesn&#39;t know the term is more likely to be able to figure out what &quot;autocompletion&quot; means from context. &quot;Intellisense&quot; is like &quot;Tide&quot; or &quot;Pledge&quot;; you&#39;d never guess what it is from the name. ;-)
