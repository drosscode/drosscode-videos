Did you go to the Data Tab.  
Then **From Other Sources**
and then **XML Data Import**?

Use the URL of the data. I used Jon Udell&#39;s Blog feed as a [test](http://blog.jonudell.net/feed/) and it worked.

If I knew of a public ADO.NET Services URL I could test it out.
It doesn&#39;t work properly because feed web services have special xml format which is different from ATOM that is used by ado.net data services.
check out this url for a not very well solution:
