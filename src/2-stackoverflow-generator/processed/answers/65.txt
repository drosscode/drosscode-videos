Are you sure that the dynamic URL is valid? For instance, if newListing.ListingPhotoURL is not a valid URL or cannot be accessed, you will get this error since you are not doing any error checking. While your code is concise, you should probably be just a little bit more verbose while you debug, or at least until you&#39;re more comfortable with the language. I would suggest rewriting your method as such:

    -(UIImage*)newUIImageWithURLString:(NSString*)urlString {
      NSParameterAssert(urlString);
      NSData *pictureData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlString]];
      NSAssert1(pictureData, @&quot;No data returned for url: %@&quot;, urlString);
      return [[UIImage alloc] initWithData:pictureData];
    }

With the method written like this, you will know right away if something is not behaving as expected (the assertion macros will throw exceptions). This also gives you more granular places to set breakpoints if you&#39;re trying to debug something.
