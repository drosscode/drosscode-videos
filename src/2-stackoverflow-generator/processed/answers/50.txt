In the ideal situation, this sort of thing is handled by the desktop environment (KDE, GNOME, XFCE), and Firefox respects those settings---it should do so on Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSUSE, at least. YMMV:

There&#39;s not going to be a single answer, because that will be happening at the X window manager level at best.  In general, you&#39;re going to need to have some chunk of code you can put into your path, and associate the name with the protocol.  Have a look at the about:config page, which is where the handlers are set up.

That&#39;s really all that Windows does too, it&#39;s just that stuff is in the registry.

[This looks like a decent drescription][1] for Firefox.

The manual way to doing it for firefox:

    open firefox
    type in about:config to location bar
    add new string
    name:  network.protocol-handler.app.myapp
    value: /path/to/program
&gt; Can I associate a system-wide handler like in Windows? or does it need to be browser-dependent?

It has to be browser-dependent. There&#39;s no cross-browser way of associating URL handlers in Linux.
