I guess it depends on what mechanism you are using to do your database inserts e.g. parameterized SQL, stored procedure, etc. If using parameterized SQL, I think your current solution is fine, although if the database table field for date allows nulls, I don&#39;t think it is necessary to pass a value for the date column in the INSERT statement if the date field is blank. If using a stored procedure, you could set the date as an [optional parameter][1] with a NULL default value.

BTW, are you using the asp.net ajax mechanism for parsing dates in JSON? e.g.

    \/Date(1169125740)\/

    //1169125740 is the number of milliseconds since UTC (Midnight January 1, 1970)
