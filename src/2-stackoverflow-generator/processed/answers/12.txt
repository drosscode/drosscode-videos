Although this is already answered correctly I thought it might be useful to provide a practical solution using your data:

This generates a rather uninformative graph!
Google Charts has a maximum length of URL that it will handle without giving that error. I&#39;m not sure what that limit is precisely, but your URL is 4774 characters long and I think the limit is just over 2000 characters.

You may need to use the simple or extended data encoding instead of text encoding. Text encoding is the least space-efficient way of encoding data for the Google Charts API. See the [Data Formats](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/formats.html) API documentation for more information.
As Greg said, your URL is too long.

&gt; The maximum length of a URL is not determined by the Google Chart API, but rather by web browser and web server considerations. Currently, URLs that are over 2048 characters in length when URL-encoded (e.g., | becomes %7C) are not recommended. As web browsers and servers evolve, this number may change. See http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html for a more in-depth discussion.
