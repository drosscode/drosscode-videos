Is the field type in the database definitely a BLOB rather than a CLOB? It certainly *looks* as if it&#39;s treating it as text data instead of binary data. What does `Reader.GetFieldType(2)` return?

Just as a side-issue, is the _filesize_ field really a string rather than an integer? Can you not just use `Reader.GetInt32(1)`?

Finally, with your size issue - when you talk about something being &quot;more than a few KB&quot; - there&#39;s a big difference between &quot;more than a few K&quot; and &quot;big enough to overflow `int.MaxValue`&quot; (which would be 2GB). Do you have anything of a few megabytes in size?
I created the field as a BLOB.  However, seeing the results of your suggestion of GetFieldType being a System.String, I&#39;m not sure.  I&#39;m using the SQLite Manager FireFox addon to manager, and it&#39;s reporting _content_ as a BLOB.  

.NET and the SQLite manager seem to be conflicting.  I can save the file properly out of the manager so I know it&#39;s stored properly -- it&#39;s just reading it into my app.

_filesize_ is a text field, it was something I just quickly added to try to debug this whole thing and I plan to change it sooner or later.

The size issue is really surprising to me, but I cannot explain it (which is why I&#39;m here :)  I can&#39;t determine what the exact size limit is, but I know it will throw an error with a file that is only 34KB.  Attached below is a copy of the exception report I generate.
