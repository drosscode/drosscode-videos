The code sample

    Shoes.app do
      para &quot;program: #{ARGV[0]}\n&quot;
      para &quot;arg1: #{ARGV[1]}\n&quot;
      para &quot;arg2: #{ARGV[2]}\n&quot;
    end

works for me when called from the wrapper `shoes.run`.  For example, if I run `./shoes.run test.app foo bar` on the command line, it displays:

    program: test.app
    arg1: foo
    arg2: bar

for me.  Perhaps your concatenation behavior is related to how you are calling Shoes, and not to the Shoes wrapper itself?

Also, the same works for me if I run `shoes` after unpacking everything.  Also, you can run

    shoes test.app -- foo bar

to insure that the app gets the arguments instead of the shoes executable.
