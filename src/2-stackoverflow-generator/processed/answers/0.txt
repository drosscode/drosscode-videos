IDEA has the same keystrokes as Eclipse for camel-case words, but you have to have the CamelHumps option turned on (it&#39;s in Settings -&gt; Editor -&gt; General -&gt; Smart Keys -&gt; Use &quot;CamelHumps&quot; words )
Yes, the answer of yalestar is correct.
Settings &gt; Editor &gt; Smart keys &gt; Use &quot;CamelHumps&quot; words

However, here is something that can be usefull to know:
If you want to be able to select the whole word by double-click on it, unselect the &quot;Honor &#39;CamelHumps&#39; words settings when selecting on double click&quot; in Settings &gt; Editor.

There is a shortcut in latest version of Android Studio. You can just tap &quot;**Shift**&quot; key twice(double click) and then in search type &quot;camelhum&quot; then the option will appear and you can toggle it on/off. I have attached an image for reference.[![enter image description here][1]][1]

As of 2022 when using Rider 2022.2.3 you go to **Settings** then under the **Keymap** section, you can search for *camelhump* to see the actions and their shortcuts:

In my case I could already use Alt+Left/Right to navigate between sub-words, but I had to define custom shortcuts to do that while selecting the sub-words. You can set the shortcut by right-clicking one of the actions and choosing *Add Keyboard Shortcut*:
