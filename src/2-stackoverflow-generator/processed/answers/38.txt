Could you do this in your PrepareViewDataForAddAction method?..

    if (!ViewData.ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            ViewData[&quot;StartDate.Hour&quot;] = &quot;Error&quot;;
        }

The other fields on the form will still populate based on the properties of the Gig object.
I think you need to do some basic client side validation first.
don&#39;t allow it to post to the server.
I think the problem is that your ViewModel does not match closely enough with your View. It&#39;s really important in MVC that your ViewModel matches your View as closely as possible.

In your ViewModel you&#39;re assuming an integer, but in your View you&#39;re using a TextBox to render the property, which will allow any kind of text. There&#39;s a mismatch here and the difficulties you are experiencing trying to map them is a symptom of the mismatch.

I think you should either:  
1. Change the type of the ViewModel property to string and then do validation in your controller to ensure the string entered is actually a number or:  
2. Change the control that the View renders to a control that will only allow a number to be entered via a custom control or Javascript validation (as @Qun Wang recommends)

Personally, I&#39;d recommend option 1. That way the ViewModel is not dependent on the View implementation.
